ACOTSPJava
==========

A Java implementation of ACO algorithms for the TSP
Originally based on Thomas St√ºtzle's ACO Algorithm, 
translated to JAVA by Adrian Wilke.

My Contribution:

Added concurrency, so more than one instance of the aco algorithm can run at the same time
Added the possibility to define a start location for the SingleDepotVRP
Added the access by a Rest-Service using Spring
